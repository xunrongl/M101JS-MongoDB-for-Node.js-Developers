##Quiz: Challenge Problem: Create Movie Entries

This problem is ungraded. It's somewhat open ended and intended to give you hands-on experience with just about everything we've discussed in this week's material. At the end of the week, we will post a solution. Until then, feel free to ask questions in the discussion forum and offer advice to other students. I would ask only that you do not just give away your solution.

Start with one of the handouts from this week. The handouts from the "All Together Now" lesson and the "Express: Handling POST Requests" lesson might provide the best starting points. Write a Node.js web application that presents users with a form containing three fields and a submit button. The fields should be:
-title
-year
-imdb

Set up a route to handle a POST request of this form. This route should use the Node.js MongoDB driver to insert a movie document into MongoDB. The movie document should have the same shape as those we looked at in lesson examples this week.

Check that you are inserting records correctly in the Mongo shell with some find() commands.

Good luck!
